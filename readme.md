### Abstract 

Adaptive clock generation techniques have emerged in recent generations of high-performance SoCs to mitigate timing failure due to supply voltage droops. Resilient techniques vary from analog voltage mixing to digital sensing and clock actuation. This work identifies a taxonomy for adaptive clock generation systems: adaptive clock distribution (ACD) and adaptive PLL-based schemes. Reported realizations in state-of-the-art processor SoCs are reviewed and key performance metrics for comparisons are identified. An evaluation plan is also proposed to compare such systems in a predictive 7nm CMOS technology.
