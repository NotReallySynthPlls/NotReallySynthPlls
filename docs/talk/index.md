## Jitter, and Our Failures to Discuss It 

| Quantity                  | Analogy      | Who Cares? |
| ------------------------- | ------------ | ---------- |
| Phase Jitter              | Position     | Data Converters, Wireline SERDES, Wireless Transceivers |
| Period Jitter             | Velocity     | Synchronous Digital Logic |
| "Cycle to Cycle" Jitter   | Acceleration | ??? |
