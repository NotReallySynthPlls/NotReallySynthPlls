abstract: |
    Adaptive clock generation techniques have emerged in recent generations of high-performance SoCs for mitigation of timing failures due to transient supply voltage droops. This work compares two prominent families of adaptive-clock generation systems: discrete adaptive clock distribution (ACD) circuits and adaptive-clock PLLs. State of the art realizations of each are compared for design-time complexity, realized performance and power consumption. We then introduce an adaptive-clock PLL design with sub-cycle reaction time which avoids many of the trade-offs cited in prior art.
